	<p>

		Throughout my college career I have continuously challenged myself to think about the type of job that would not feel like work.
	Growing up, both of my parents loved their careers and encouraged both my brother and I to find what we would look forward to every morning.
		<br>
		</p>
	<p id = 'bold'>I discovered my need for creative stimulation, team collaboration, and some sort of underlying connection to the organization I am working at.</b>
		<br>
	</p>
		<br> 
	<p>
		I have been fortunate to be involved in an on-canpus organization called, the Michigan Fashion Media Summit, commonly known as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_mfms/" id = "mfms"><i>The MFMS</i></a>. 
		Here, I was immersed in an extremley motivated, intelligent, and innovative group of people. This organization was where I found my true love for the fashion and beauty industry. 
		It erased the glamour we see from an outside point of view, but, because of this, intensified my desire to be even more involved in the process.
	</p>
		<br>
	<p>
		During my experience in the MFMS as well as my past marketing internships at SharkNinja and QuickenLoans, I realized how much I love this industry. 
		I want to improve a company's accessibility, internally and externally.
		It is important that the consumer recieves an equal opportunity to access information. This means that their website and deisgn should maintain consistency for all people, no matter their challenges. 
		I also believe in the importance of fair and transparent marketing and it is something I wish to emphasize throughout my career. 
	</p>
		<br>
	<p> 
		The MFMS, complemented with my studies in the School of Information at the Unviersity of Michigan, have highlighted my passion for the marketing industry, specifically with technology.
		I am confident my skills I have developed thus far will make me a strong asset to a variety of companies.
